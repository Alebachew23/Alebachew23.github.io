Hello, ሰላም ጤና ይስጥልኝ 

I’m a PhD candidate in the final stages of my research in genomics and host-pathogen interactions focusing on genomics and host–pathogen interactions at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/). 

Previously, i was [WHO/TDR fellow](https://tdr.who.int/home/our-work/strengthening-research-capacity/clinical-research-and-development-fellowship) at [Infectious Disease Data Observatory](https://www.iddo.org/) and [Menzies School of Health Research](https://www.menzies.edu.au/)  i applied population genomics and bioinformatics approaches to study Plasmodium vivax in Ethiopia. I am also the recipient of the [APHL/CDC Bioinformatics fellowship](https://www.aphl.org/Career-Pathways/fellowships/Pages/default.aspx) at the [Centers for Disease control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/index.html). In addition, i have served as both data and project manager for the [Pan-African Malaria Genetic Epidemiology Network](https://www.malariagen.net/project/pamgen/) supporting efforts to advance genomic survelliance of malaria across the continent.
